# To remember
This project attempts to use the most recent versions of the various technologies invloved. This means Vue.js 3, and class-based component syntax, among others. For the screenshot of initial project choices we have:

# Getting started
Make sure you have Node, Node Package Manager amd and Vue-cli installed on your system.


```bash
$ node --version
v14.4.0

$ npm --version
6.14.5

$ vue --version
@vue/cli 4.5.8
```

See [installing Node and NPM on Ubuntu 18LTS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04), and for [Vue-cli install](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html).

Now, it's time to install the actual project dependencies (as are found in `package.json`), the command for this is `npm install`.

Then, once all these requirements are satisifed we can do various things. For example on the command line in the project repository:

```bash
# Stats about dependencies in browser
vue ui

# Compiles and hot-reloads for development
npm run serve

# Compiles and minifies for production
npm run build

# Run your unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run your end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).



# Principal project dependencies
